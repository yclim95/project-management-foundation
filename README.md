## Deliver Successful Project

```
1. Initiating
2. Planning
3. Executing
4. Monitoring & Controlling
```

```
1. Who 
- Functional Managers
2. What
- Skill sets
- Milestones
- Constraints
- Schedules
3. How
- Weekly 1:1 
```

```
1. Scope
2. Schedule
3. Budget
```

## What you should Know?
```
Goal: Is to improve the hospital's schedule capability & Maximize the use of facilities
```


# 1. Get to Know Project Management
## 1.1 What is a project?
```
- Temporary endeavor (Beginning & End) that has a
- specific & unique GOAL (Product / Service / Outcome) & 
- BUDGET
```

```
- Introducing a new system is called a PROJECT
- Has a SPECIFIC beginning & ending (up for operation)
- Has a Unique GOAL (solve hospital's scheduling issue)
- Budget ($$ & Resource Time)
```

## 1.2 What is project management?
```
- More than just Organizing skills & Supervising others
- Means Applying, KNOWLEDGE & SKILL & TOOLS & TECHNIQUES to achieve your project's OBJECTIVES
- OVERALL SUMS up based questions
1. What problems are you solving?
2. How are you going to solve this? (several possible strategy)
- Once select approach, starts to flesh out solutions
- Gathering Requirements 
- Identifying Deliverable
- Defining Project Scope
- What is your plan (Work duration & resources need & budget & Process)
- How will you know when you're done? (by defining success criteria)
- How well did the project go? (Review the project -> what worked well, what didn't)

3. What problem are you solving?
4. How are you going to solve it?
5. What is your plan for getting the project done?
6. How can you tell when you're done?
7. How well did the project go?
```

```
Success Criteria 
- Quantifiable & Measurable results that show the project is complete
```

## 1.3 What it takes to be a project manager?
```
1. Technical skills
- project plan
- project schedule
- reading schedule
- using critical path & Measuring performance

2. Business expertise
- Delivers value
- Understand organization's business (what it does, what consider important)
- This way, able to see how project FITS in, & can make good decision to ensure the project is successful

3. Problem solving
Figure how to 
- Achieve project objective
- Meet the schedule & Budget
- While solving problem that arise

4. Interpersonal skills
- May work with people from different department or even company

5. Strong Leadership
- Inspire your people 
- Help to become a true team
- Guide them to do things right 
- Hold them Accountable
- Motivate to give their best

6. Example (Project Manager)
- The sponsor of Project T5 assigned you as the project manager, and the project has already been approved. What is the first thing you need to do as the project manager?\
- Solution (Review what has been done and complete any tasks not addressed.)
- Why? (Since the project was approved before the project manager was chosen, the project manager needs to take these steps next.)
```



## 1.4 Project Management Life Cycle 

```
1. Initiating
- Define Project (Whats the project supposed to accomplish?)
- Access Scope
- Determine resources & cost needed
- Identify stakeholders
- Ask for approval to proceed

2. Planning
Figure out how you're going to perform the project. It answers the following Q:
- What are we going to do?
- How are we going to do it?
- How will we know when it's done?

3. Executing
- Start to launch a project
- Bring resources on board & get them settled in
- Explain the rules you using to run the project
- Lastly, put the plan to action.

4. Monitoring & Controlling
- Check the progress of project 
- compare to what was planned (If it is different, You take action to get back onboard )

5. Closing Process
- Short stage 
- Important stage
- Get approval from client to ACCEPT PROJECT is completed
- Document Project Performance
- Gather lesson learned
- Close Contracts
- Help resources move on to their next Project
```

## 1.5 Traditional vs. Agile Project Management
```
1. Traditional Approach (Waterfall)
- Goals clearly defined
- When: Simplicity 
- When: Low risk
- When: Familiar Technology
- When: Experience Resourced
- When: Clear Solution

2. Agile Approach
- Produce Deliverable at regular intervals (Iterations / Sprints)
- Value delivered sooner
- More CUSTOMER INVOLVEMENT
- Small & Independent & More experience teams (without supervision)
- This approach is best because it uses short iterations or sprints to deliver partial solutions, while customer feedback improves the overall solution.
- When: Unclear solution
```

### 1.5.1 Agile Project Management
```
1. Planning / Iteration 
- Develop Detailed Plans for Each Iteration

2. Executing
- Easier
- Work on 1 Iteration at a time
- In a TEAM that consist of SMALL INDEPENDENT HIGHLY SKILLED people

3. Monitoring / Controlling
- Closely monitoring & controlling
- COMMUNICATE faster & more frequently in a TEAM
- This process group checks on the status of the project and compares it to what was planned.


4. Closing
- For each Iteration (Has its own closing process)
- Accept its specific deliverable
- When FINAL iteration is accepted, Can close the entire project
```


## 1.6 How organization structure affects project
```
1. Classic Function Hierarchy
- Each person reports to ONLY ONE supervisor
- Project Manager: Almost no authority
- Functional Manager: In charge of project budget
- Resources: Do not need to report to Project Manager (Report to Functional Manager)
- Project Manager: Has divided responsibilities

2. Matrix
- Report to BOTH functional Manager & Project Manager
- Still functional hierarchy
- BUT, SUPPORT projects more than pure hierarchy
- PROJECT Manager: WEAK, BALANCED OR STRONG (Depending on emphasis on project)
- PROJECT Manager: has SOME authority
- Resources: Report to 2 managers (assigned to project: Functional & Project Manager)
- Full Matrix: Project Manager & Project Admin staff work FULL TIME on PROJECT

3. Projectized
- Most people work on PROJECT
- Why: More easier for project managers to produce result:
- Project Manager: has ALMOST COMPLETE authority (include BUDGET)
- Resource: Dedicated to Project Work & (Report to PM) 
- FULL TIME: Work full Time (PM & Admin staff)

4. What Organization Structure has Large Influence On?
- How Project are Performed?
- How much Project Manager can Do?
- How easy it is to make project SUCCESSFUL?
```

## 1.7 Organization Culture
```
1. What is organization culture?
- Factors that guide people's BEHAVIOR & DECISION within an organization.

2. What factors?
- Shared values
- Beliefs
- Assumptions
- Habits 
- Languages 
```

### 1.7.1 How organization culture affects project
```
1. Shaping Culture (How ?)
- Mission statement (best thing to do)

2. Leadership & Authority (Trust)  (How ?)
- Clear Goal: Management
- Responsibility Delegation

3. Work Environment  (How ?)
- Positive environment: People are MOTIVATED to get things DONE
- NEGATIVE environment: Spend alot of time managing TEAM
- EXAMPLE: Belives in following RULES no matter what
- EXAMPLE: Belive in nurturing INNOVATION (employee to try new approach)
- Does your organization put RESULTS ahead of PROEDURES or vise versa?
- Some rules can't be broken without severe consequences. If you determine that the rule can be broken, you can deliver earlier with minor consequences. You must have a plan for what you will do if you break the rule and don't deliver earlier.
```

### 1.7.2 Navigating Culture
```
1. Know the boundaries (Project goal: always to achieve objectives)
2. Respect Change management (Multiple review & require approval from several people)
3. Respect local culture
```


## 1.8 Project Management Software

- Complexity
```

# 2. First Thing First
## 2.1 Initiate a Project
```
1. Get committment to move forward
2. Go ahead and start planning IF client approve
3. 1st step - Assign a Project Manager (PM) - might assign after the project's been approved
4. Objective: Define Project
- Identify the problem project is supposed to solve & 
- Gather information about the project (objectives, requirements, deliverables and more)
5. Prepare the project charter (after define project)
- formally authorize the project
- Describe the authority of the project manager
- 
```

## 2.2 Identify Project Stakeholders
```
1. Stakeholder - Has a stake in the outcome of your project

2. Stakeholder include:
- Customer
- Project Sponsor
- Department
- Team members

3. What stakeholder expect from project & How they contribute to it?
- To understand stakeholders' importance, influence & interst in the project
- Build relationship with influential stakeholders
- Ensure stakeholders are statisfied with end result
```

### 2.2.1 Project Customer
```
1. Project Customer
- A person / Group with a problem to solve

2. Project Customer brings 3 Crucial things to project
- Funds the Project
- Informs what needs to be done
- Aprrove deliverables (start to finish)
```

### 2.2.2 Project Sponsor
```
1. Project Sponsor
- A person who wants to see the project SUCCEED
- Has sufficient AUTHORITY to make that happen
- Example: Several stakeholders for a project disagree on the priorities of many project objectives. Who would you ask first for help resolving this issue? 
- Why? (The project sponsor wants the project to succeed and has enough authority to help you resolve issues, particularly with other stakeholders.)

2. Project Sponsor brings 3 Crucial things to project
- Prioritize objectives
- Talk to stakeholders
- Suggest Improvements to the project plan
```

### 2.2.3 Project Functional / Line Manager
```
1. A person who runs department
2. Achieve department Goals
3. Manage team member

4. Example (Project Functional / Line manager)
- You are managing a project that is implementing a new financial system. You need to include some of the finance department's resources on the team. Which stakeholder should you approach?
- Why? (This stakeholder is most accountable for the resources that are needed for a project.)
```

### 2.2.4 Project Team member
```
1. Their job depends on their assignment
2. May depend on how well they perform
```

### 2.2.4 Project Team member
```
1. Invested & Affected by project outcomes
```

## 2.3 Analyze Stakeholders
```
1. Overview
- WHo the stakeholders are for your project?
- Which ones are most important
- Best Way to work with them
- Stakeholder Analysis (Solution)

2. Stakeholder Analysis 
- Store information there as you identify stakeholders
- Learn about their part in your project
- Both does not happen all at once
- Example: Krisha is gathering information on her stakeholders, such as department names, factors that motivate them, who they listen to, and their contributions on the project. What is this document called?
- Why? (This document includes much of the information Krisha needs to effectively communicate with each stakeholder.)
```

### 2.3.1 Analyze Stakeholders (Steps)
```
1. 1st step: How your stakeholdrs are connected to your project? What motivates them? (Identify)
- Starrt by including department, business unit, or company the stakeholder belongs to & their posiition in the organization.
- Next, determine who the stakeholder listens to (Advisors)
- Then, identify the project objectives (stakeholders care about & how they prioritize them)
- Categorize each Stakeholder by (Influence & Interest) in the project
- Finally, DOCUMENT the stakeholder's contributions to the project (expectations) & who to turn to for things you need
```

## 2.4 Identify Project Goals
```
1. Identify what the customer really wants
2. Goals:
- Defines the end result (Project delivery)
- To solves the problem
- Takes advantage of opportunity
- Drives everything that happens in the project, to ensure you got it right
```

### 2.4.1 Identify Project Goals (Step)

```
1. Problem Statement
- Clearly defines the PROBLEM / OPPORTUNITY
- Its great if can FIT IN 1 SENTENCE 
- EX question: Why do we need a new sechduling system?
- EX answer: hospital resources seem to be either jammed up or sitting idle.
- Ex answer (reason to answer): Procedures require specific equipment & staff
- Ex (Problem statement):
Hospital resources aren't being utilized efficiently, because scheduling doesn't ensure that the neccessary equipment, staff, and facilities are available.
Funding is avaible to address scheduling issues.
- Ex (Project Goals)
The project will deliver scheduling improvements so hospital resources can be scheduled efficiently. 
The project will take advantage of funding available for productive and technology enhancements.

2. Example (Problem Statement)
- Your client has asked for a project that will fix productivity concerns with the customer service department. After asking "why" several times, you are able to determine the cause and create a _____. 
- Why? (This is what clearly defines the problem or opportunity that the project will address.)
```



## 2.5 Define Project Objectives

```
1. Overall 
- After defining project GOALS, can start by identifying more DETAILED objectives
- Help the (Project scope, approach choose, success critieria need to meet)

2. Project Objective
- Project objectives help identify the items you include in project scope.

3. Business Objectives
- Support your organization's goals
- Example: Increase market share to 25% / Provide word class health care.

4. Financial Objectives
- All about money
- Example: Increase revenue by 15% / cut costs by 10%

5. Quality Objectives
- Specify How good reslts needs to be
- Example: Decrease staph infections by 80% / Decrease readmittance by 75%

6. Technical Objectives
- Technical specification for equipments
- Example: Introduce mobile equipment for hospital, ambulance, & remote emergency site.

7. Performance
- Example: Finish project before grant expires. (by specific date)

8. Project Objectives (Example)
- Project objectives help you flesh out a project by _____.
- Answer: defining project scope
- Why? (Project objectives help identify the items you include in project scope.)
```



### 2.5.1 Project Objectives Documenting Best Practices

```
Use 'SMART' criteria (Clear Objectives)

1. S pecific Objectives
- Inform what needs to be achieved
- Well defined, clear, and unambiguous
- Example: Increase revenue by 15%

2. M easurable Objectives
- Show how much has been achieved
- Is it easy to achieved
- With specific criteria that measure your progress toward the accomplishment of the goal
- Example: The hospital can measure the decrease in readmittance / revenue increase.
- With Qualitative measures, you might use survey responses, such as (minimum patient satistfaction rating of 4.5 starts)
- Example: Ramesh is creating objectives for his project. Which SMART step will help him identify actual progress?   

3. A chievable Objectives
- Tell what ca be done with resources available
- Attainable and not impossible to achieve
- Challenging objectives : can motivate people / might give up if think its impossible

4. R ealistic Objetives 
- Within reach, realistic, and relevant to your life purpose

5. T ime-related Objetives
- Identify when objectives need to be achieved
- Be sure to set a clear target date
- With a clearly defined timeline, including a starting date and a target date. The purpose is to create urgency.
- Eample: The government grants might be used by December 31st, 2020.

* Finally Project GOAL & OBJECTIVES are identified
- work with apprpirate stakeholders
- to perform a benefit analysis
- Why? Validate the project aligns with (organization's mission & strategy) & delivers expected value to the business
```



## 2.6 Choose a Strategy

```
1. Overall 
- How you can evaluate alternative strategies &
- Select the right solution

2. Braintstorming

3. Solution: Decision matrix
```



### 2.6.1 Brainstorming

```
1. Identify possible strategies
- Work as a group
- Read problem statement, goal & objectives &
- Begin Generating Possible Strategies

2. Allow Free Flow of Ideas

3. Avoid Evaluation
- Get as many ideas written down as possible before begin evaluation.
```



### 2.6.2 Decision Matrix

```
1. Help to compare the options
2. 1st should evaluate how well each stregy satisfies the project objectives
3. Method to quickly shorten the list of contender (competitor): To check whether a strategy satisfies all the must-have objectives.
4. Next, rate the performance of objective
5. Increase weighting: When some objectives are more important > than others.
6. Winner: Strategy with the highest overall rating
7. Top Strategy 
- Is the strategy feasible? (solution: feasibile study)
- Are the risks acceptable? (solution: inital risk analysis)
- Does strategy fit the culture of organization?

* Evaluate alternate solutions HELPS TO PICK THE BEST SOLUTION for your project.

8. Example (Decision Matrix)
- Your team has identified possible strategies for a project. The team is now evaluating them using a decision matrix. What is the purpose of weighting the objectives?
- Why? (Weighting objectives allows you to determine which strategy addresses the most important objectives.)
```



## 2.7 Gather Requirements

```
1. Overall 
- Project Goal (Done)
- Project Objectives (Done)
- Project Strategy (Done)
- Define what must project DELIVER, known as REQUIREMENT

2. Why essentials?
- Stakeholders would not be satisfied (If True REQUIREMENTS Fails to identified)
- Project might thake longer time & higher cost (If include REQUIREMENTS that aren't neccessary)

3. EX Project Objective: Decrease resecheduling procedures by 75%

4. EX Project Requirement 
- Silmultaneously sechdule staff, equirement, and facilities for a procedure

5. Requirement Challenges
- Incorrect requirements (Stakeholders might describe requirement incorrectly
- Provide inconsistent / contradictory requirements
- Missing Requirements (Leave out requirements they need / include nice to have)
- Unnecessary requirements (Try to squeeze their requirements into your project)
- Customer don't commit time (Stakeholders often refuse committing time to define requirements)

6. Requirement Analysis Techniques
- Interview
- Focus Group
- Observation 
- Questionnaires & Surveys
- Analyze Existing Documents

7. Start Analyzing Requirements
```



### 2.7.1 Interview

```
1. Main Point: Interview the right people & Come up with a list of questions.
```



### 2.7.2 Focus Group

```
1. Main Point: Involve several groups (with representative from each group) to discuss the requirements for the project.
2. Might help to obtain buy-in from the departments that attend.
3. Example (Focus Group)
- Which technique would you most likely use to gather valid requirements and get buy-in from various departments?
- Why? (This type of requirements gathering is usually face-to-face and is best for obtaining buy-in or agreements from several groups.)
```



### 2.7.3 Observation

```
1. Main Point: Observe how people work.
2. Watch what people do in their day-to-day activities.
3. How to validate the requirements: write them up, and review them with the workers
```



### 2.7.4 Questionnaires & Surveys

```
1. Main Point: To get requirements from stakeholders.
2. Build these docuements carefully, so these questions don't influence the answers people provide.
```



### 2.7.5 Analyze Existing Documents

```
1. Main Point: Identify requirements by analyzing documents / reverse-engineering products (If documentation / results already exist)
```



### 2.7.6 Analyzing Requirements

```
1. Analyze intial requirements (Ensure it make sense)
- Inconsistent / duplicate rqeuirements

2. Clarify with stakeholders (once done analysis)
- It may take several rounds.

3. Documenting requirements (Once it make sense)
- Clear
- Concise
- Organized

4. Developing Requirements
```



## 2.8 Identify Project Deliverables & Success Criteria

```
1. Overall 
- Project Delivables (results) of what a project delivers
- Delievrables are measured by success criteria

2. Process 
2.1 Identify END DELIVERABLES
2.2 Identify INTERMEDIATE DELIVERABLES
2.3 Define clear & quantifiable SUCCESS CRITERIA
```



### 2.8.1 Project Deliverables

```
1. Can be Tangible
- Building
- A new Product
- A new Service
- More abstraact (Improve results)

2. Define project scope (What is  & What is not included in project)

3. Helps you measure progress (while your project is underway)

4. Document Project Deliverbles
- 1st Start by Listing the END DELIVERABLES (end result of what projects delivers @ at the end of the project)
- EXAMPLLE: new scheduling system & processes launched.
- 2nd, document intermediate deliverables
- EXAMPLE: Sign a contract with the scheduling system vendor.
- 3rd, Try to define deliverables that can be accomplished in the timeframe between status report
- EXAMPLE: Evaluate progress based on deliverables completed since the last report.

5. Example (Project Deliverable)
- Banton is defining his project deliverables. Which statement describes what a project deliverable is?
- Why? (A project deliverable is defined as a result that a project delivers, and helps define the project scope.)
```



### 2.8.2 Measuring Success

```
1. Overall 
- How can you tell what you received is what the STAKEHOLDER wants?
- Need quantiable criteria you can measure them with.

2. Example of Success Criteria
- Signed vendor contracts
- Certificate of Occupancy
- 4 / 5 rating on surveys (increased in customer satistfaction)

3. Example (Success Criteria)
- Rudolph, the project manager, is trying to obtain customer approval of project deliverables. It is taking longer than he anticipated because the customer wants to discuss the results. What is the most likely reason for these delays?
- Why? (Success criteria that are unclear or not quantifiable can make it difficult to determine whether deliverables are acceptable.)
```



## 2.9 Identify Project Assumptions & Risks

```
1. Assumptions
- Would not have ALL information that is needed (Project Initialization)
- Just make assumptions (Project Initalization)
- Revist & Modify as neccessary (LATER stage)
- Example: For Schedule Project, I would not know how much system customization is needed, until the vendor is chosen which can affect how many (in-house resources) needed & (how long) the project takes.
- Example (Assumption): Would not rrequire much customization. Will need 3 in-house IT resources, and will need a month to finish their part of project.
- Should bring up (open to everyone): Make sure everyone is on the same page
- Ask about expectations
- Ask questions to get answer

2. Example (Assumption)
- After the plan is approved and project work begins, Tara's boss is not happy about a project delay for an upgrade. The vendor thought Tara's team would do the upgrade, and Tara thought the vendor would do it. What was missed in this situation?
- Answer: An assumption was not identified.
- Why? (Assumptions are created during the project initiation phase when you do not know everything that will happen.)

2. Risk
- A situation / event that might occur.
- Could affect project POSTIVELY / NEGATIVELY
- Management might not invest in it.

3. Example (Risk)
- As part of the project definition, Bisa identifies risks for the project. What is the purpose of doing this during project initiation?
- Solution: so management can decide whether the risks are serious enough to warrant denying the project
- Why? (If the project has numerous, serious risks, management might decide to choose a different project that offers benefits without so much uncertainty.)
```



## 2.10 Prepare a Project Scope Statement

```
1. Describes the boundaries of the project (included & not included)

2. Project Scope in Writing
- Helps avoid scope creep (Additional unexpected deliverables)
- Reminds stakeholders what was agreed upon
- Helps track for change management (Add them if Stakeholders really want it - Change Controll Process)

3. Everything you done during PROJECT INITIATION feeds into tthis document
- Goal and Objectives 
- Within Scope 
- Out of Scope
- Deliverables
- Success Criteria
- Assumptions
- Risks 
- Constraints

4. In-Scope (Example)
- Redesign processes for scheduling staff, equipment & facilities
- Delivers new scheduling system & processes
- Document Processes & System Use
- Train staff on Processes & System

5. Out-of-Scope (Example)
- Update work shif scheduling system
- Shheduling resident rooms

6. Example (Project Scope)
- Why is it important to document the project scope?
- AAnswer: to remind stakeholders what they agreed to and to prevent scope creep
- Why? (With the project scope in writing, you will be able to identify whether requests are within scope or need to be handled by change management.)

7. Example (Project Scope)
- Sakait has done some extra work to appease a client. Now the client is asking her to do one more task, which is significant and not part of project scope. What should Sakait do?
- Answer: Sakait should tell the client the task is not within scope and add the task using the change control process.
- Why? (This is the best approach for Sakait and would help to prevent any further scope creep.)
```



## 2.11 Prepare a Project Charter

```
1. Overview (Before Creating Project Charter : Perform Cross Check if the following is DONE)
- Project definition (the customer or sponsor can make an informed decision whether the project makes sense for the organization.)
- Scope Statement (Done)
- Get approval to proceed
- Prepare project charter

2. Project Charter
- Authorized & Publicizes the project 
- This document describes the scope, objectives, stakeholders, and the project manager's authority and responsibilities for a project.

3. Content for Project Charter
- Project name
